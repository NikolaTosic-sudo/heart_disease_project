# heart_disease_project
Machine Learning model for predicting does patient have heart disease or not

This is my first Machine Learning project I did. Still have not exported the Machine Learning model, I will after improving it more.

Exported a environment I used for you to freely import it if you want to see what I did.

<ul>
  In this project I used: 

  <li>* pandas</li>
  <li>* matplotlib</li>
  <li>* scikit-learn</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  Models I used are:
  <li>KNearest Neighbor</li>
  <li>Random Forest Classifier</li>
  <li>Logistic Regression</li>
  <li>CatBoost Classifier</li>
</ul>
